The goal of a semantic segmentation algorithm with an Aerial Semantic Segmentation Drone Dataset is to accurately classify and label each pixel in an aerial image captured by a drone, assigning it to a specific semantic category. Semantic segmentation involves dividing an image into meaningful segments or regions, where each segment corresponds to a specific object or class.
The Aerial Semantic Segmentation Drone Dataset provides a collection of annotated aerial images, where each image has ground truth labels (the mask) indicating the correct semantic class for each pixel. The algorithm's training involves learning from these annotated examples, enabling it to generalize and accurately segment new, unseen aerial images.
